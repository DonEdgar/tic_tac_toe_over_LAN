# tic_tac_toe_over_LAN
I want to learn more C and network programming, and figured this little project will help me. 

Right now, the plan is to make a simple tic tac toe game you can play with a friend using a TCP/IP connection. Nothing crazy or groundbreaking but maybe some will find it useful *shoulder shrugs*
